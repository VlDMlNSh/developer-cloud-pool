## 1. Project objective, scope and priority order

Developer Cloud Pool is an independent, cloud-first, governed agent platform and remote development environment. The goal is to make a secure web console accessible from iPhone and desktop, then qualify the cloud execution pool and only afterward move to native mobile and external compute.

**Mandatory order**
1. Deploy and qualify Contour A on free GitHub infrastructure (and a hosting path proven to remain free).
2. Deliver authenticated remote web access from mobile and desktop; verify real pool status and permitted operations.
3. Qualify task intake, Supervisor/Worker execution, safe model/provider routing, quota accounting, secret isolation, state persistence, recovery and audit.
4. Complete independent security/governance review and publish acceptance evidence for Contour A.
5. Only after Contour A is ACCEPTED, begin Contour B product development: native iOS MediaHub OS / Developer Mobile AI, local media assistant, external owner-operated servers and related product capabilities.

Contour B is explicitly deferred. It must not be pulled forward because a scope document or prototype exists.

**Web-first owner priority (Issue #22, 2026-11-06):** authenticated remote web access first; native iOS Developer Mobile AI second; external servers third. The web application must be usable in an iPhone browser without requiring a native app.

**UI direction:** restrained graphite/gray surfaces and typography; no prominent blue or green accents. Reuse the existing graphite mobile dashboard and mature components rather than redesigning from scratch.

**Free-tier constraint:** GitHub Free and genuinely free service tiers only. No paid fallback, no paid managed DB/cache, no billing workaround, no payment-card workaround, no upgrade, and no resource creation that can incur charges. GitHub-hosted runners are ephemeral and are not persistent web hosts.

## 2. Source-of-truth and cross-project boundaries

- This repository is the engineering source of truth for Cloud Pool: https://github.com/VlDMlNSh/developer-cloud-pool
- MediaHub OS is a separate repository and a source of provider inventory/governance context, not the Cloud Pool control plane: https://github.com/VlDMlNSh/mediahub-os
- Never merge repository states, authority, credentials, quotas, or product-state responsibilities across the two projects.
- MediaHub canonical map: https://github.com/VlDMlNSh/mediahub-os/blob/docs/mediahub-chat-tree-map-20261012/docs/architecture/MEDIAHUB-CHAT-TREE-MAP.md
- MediaHub bootstrap: https://github.com/VlDMlNSh/mediahub-os/blob/docs/mediahub-chat-tree-map-20261012/docs/architecture/MEDIAHUB-CONTEXT-BOOTSTRAP-INSTRUCTION.md
- MediaHub checkpoint: https://github.com/VlDMlNSh/mediahub-os/blob/docs/mediahub-chat-tree-map-20261012/docs/checkpoints/mediahub-next-continuation-checkpoint-2026-10-12-current.md
- MediaHub master roadmap: https://github.com/VlDMlNSh/mediahub-os/blob/docs/mediahub-chat-tree-map-20261012/docs/checkpoints/MEDIAHUB-MASTER-DEVELOPMENT-ROADMAP-1.0.md
- MediaHub Issue #301: https://github.com/VlDMlNSh/mediahub-os/issues/301
- MediaHub PR #437: https://github.com/VlDMlNSh/mediahub-os/pull/437 (previously observed merged)
- MediaHub PR #441: https://github.com/VlDMlNSh/mediahub-os/pull/441 (previously observed open/unmerged; refresh before relying)
- Preserve MediaHub Baseline 2.0 and historical IDs where applicable. Jarvis, ASTRA A0, and MediaHub Product State Authority have distinct authority boundaries. A technical capability is not authorization.

## 3. Repository state, branches and governance

- Repository metadata currently reports default branch `Основной`, public repository, pushed_at 2026-11-06T12:17:27Z, open issues count 28.
- Observed default HEAD: `64d2636d4500127e635c214ccfb722c6b3fcda80`.
- Branch API returned `protected=false` for `Основной` and all listed feature/docs branches. This field alone does NOT establish whether a repository ruleset is effective.
- Active repository ruleset collection returned one active ruleset: ID `26550182`, name `Основной — verified`, target branch, enforcement active. Its current conditions/rules must be read directly before any merge or dispatch; do not infer effective protections solely from the collection listing.
- Historical Issue #1 evidence (2026-11-04) reported exact selector `refs/heads/Основной`, PR required, zero required approvals, deletion/non-fast-forward restrictions, review-thread resolution enabled, no bypass actors, and `POOL_DISPATCH_ENABLED=false` read back through owner-authenticated GitHub CLI. Treat the variable read-back and detailed ruleset condition as historical until rechecked; do not read secret values.
- Issue #2 is closed and contains an earlier governance alignment history; its former ruleset ID 26535481 was reported absent. Current ruleset collection shows ID 26550182.
- PRs are not automatically accepted because mergeable=true or CI passed. Formal independent review, effective ruleset details, provenance, exact-head checks and acceptance criteria remain separate gates.
- The current documentation branch `docs/cross-chat-continuation-2026-11-06` is a working continuation branch. PR #27 remains OPEN/DRAFT/UNMERGED. Do not call it merged or the default branch.

## 4. Cloud execution architecture and actual runtime status

### Intended architecture
- 20-slot GitHub-hosted execution architecture: DESIGN, not a running 20-worker pool.
- Pool Supervisor/task queue: IMPLEMENTED SCAFFOLD; NOT RUN for real task execution.
- Pool Worker: implementation exists for one DeepSeek Harness (DSH) headless smoke profile; NOT RUN as a qualified execution runtime.
- Scheduled/event-driven wake-up/reconciliation: implementation exists; runtime qualification NOT VERIFIED.
- General-purpose agent execution, durable checkpoint/resume and automatic continuation: NOT IMPLEMENTED.
- DSH selected as candidate task runtime; developer-preview evaluation NOT RUN.
- Baseline runner resource probe: implementation exists; NOT RUN.
- Cloud runtime deployment and profile qualification: NOT RUN.
- No local deployment before cloud-first pool qualification.
- GitHub-hosted Actions runners are ephemeral; they cannot serve as the persistent authenticated web console or durable state store.

### Dispatch trust boundary
- Dispatch must remain fail-closed. Do not enable `POOL_DISPATCH_ENABLED`, invoke Supervisor/Worker/DSH, launch provider/model calls, or perform resource probes unless all relevant governance, issuer/capability, security and acceptance gates are satisfied.
- Historical workflow/contract work includes owner-originated `pool:ready` event provenance, approval marker bound to issue/immutable SHA/allowlisted DSH profile, single-use approval consumption, stale-claim recovery to needs-review, trusted workflow metadata, Supervisor run binding and duplicate-run checks.
- PR #7 contains owner approval and Worker-side authorization hardening. Its latest branch SHA at last recorded update was `effda14e286ebe276fee2b3ead96c4ed2122a45e`; code CI passed at earlier immutable code head `9c8afd2e3530b970e7f26a0b8d3d1bac62636f96`, while later branch commits were documentation-only. Independent review and live Worker runtime verification remain NOT RUN.
- PR #8 is a bounded task-matrix builder stacked on PR #7; not wired into Supervisor and not independently qualified.
- PRs #10/#11 address GitHub Free runner policy validation; do not infer all CI or deployment routes are free solely from static policy tests.
- Keep task queue, approvals, execution, recovery, evidence and user-facing read API as distinct trust boundaries.

## 5. Remote web console (primary Contour A user surface)

Controlling issue: https://github.com/VlDMlNSh/developer-cloud-pool/issues/22

### Existing UI and hosting direction
- PR #6: read-only graphite mobile dashboard shell; static demo fixtures only, no live API, auth or task submission. Exact-head static UI/contract CI previously passed at `5b8469b3bb691ff48f8be9bda9aea0969d42f537`; browser/device visual QA and independent review NOT VERIFIED.
- PR #24: hosting ADR and Jarvis Experience API contract. OPEN/DRAFT/UNMERGED; branch `docs/jarvis-web-experience-adr-2026-11-06`; head `d9a7389d4bb5562bb6f2a1e853ebc818659e2cd6`; base `Основной` @ `64d2636d4500127e635c214ccfb722c6b3fcda80`. Exact-head OpenAPI Validation run `42188894226` and Pool Contract Validation run `42188894227` previously COMPLETED/SUCCESS. No independent review recorded.
- PR #25: Hono web console prototype. OPEN/DRAFT/UNMERGED; branch `feat/jarvis-hono-web-prototype-2026-11-06`; head `d8521571ede91d7f6d7fb6d5ee37747ac94385ea`; base default branch at `64d2636...`. Exact-head Jarvis Web Prototype Validation run `42188468546` and Pool Contract Validation run `42188468584` previously COMPLETED/SUCCESS. Uses Hono Worker + Workers Static Assets and existing graphite UI. Health is service-only; protected reads return 503; mutation routes return 405. This is a fail-closed prototype, not an authenticated deployed service.
- PR #30: synthetic oauth4webapi compatibility proof, stacked on PR #25. OPEN/DRAFT/UNMERGED; branch `proof/github-oauth4webapi-compat-2026-11-06`; base branch `feat/jarvis-hono-web-prototype-2026-11-06` @ `d8521571ede91d7f6d7fb6d5ee37747ac94385ea`; head `ad9f9ac598a2414b5209b6923094b16be64630ae`; 3 files changed. Exact-head workflow `GitHub OAuth Protocol Compatibility (Synthetic)`, run `42216422883`, job `127887461269`, COMPLETED/SUCCESS. Job steps include pinned protocol library install and synthetic compatibility test. Formal reviews: 0. Combined commit-status contexts: 0 / pending. The named exact-head Actions run is positive CI evidence; empty status contexts are not a pass.
- PR #30 tests synthetic state validation/mismatch rejection, PKCE S256, form-encoded `client_secret_post`, synthetic token response, Bearer-authenticated synthetic `GET https://api.github.com/user` and synthetic numeric user identity. All responses are supplied by customFetch; no live GitHub OAuth/API requests or real credentials. `panva/oauth4webapi@3.8.8` is installed in CI without saving to project manifests/lockfile. This proves synthetic protocol-library fit only, not live interoperability or production auth.
- PR #30 report: https://github.com/VlDMlNSh/developer-cloud-pool/blob/proof/github-oauth4webapi-compat-2026-11-06/docs/reports/2026-11-06-oauth4webapi-github-compatibility.md
- PR #27: this documentation/context branch, OPEN/DRAFT/UNMERGED; head before current consolidation `ae542e7f9496e4c7e113682edf40b1a67cf2dd33`; base default branch @ `64d2636...`; CI previously NOT VERIFIED.
- Preferred hosting candidate is Cloudflare Workers Static Assets + Hono, subject to actual free entitlement verification. workers.dev namespace `jarvis-developer-cloud-pool.workers.dev` was previously provisioned/read back; this does not prove Workers Free entitlement or deployability.
- Prior Cloudflare read: 0 Worker scripts; Workers Free entitlement NOT VERIFIED because connected OAuth integration lacked Billing Read; Access disabled/not required; no Worker deployment. Re-read Cloudflare state before any deployment. Do not pay, upgrade, add card or create billable resources.

### Required production web-console controls (NOT IMPLEMENTED unless explicitly stated)
- Server-side GitHub OAuth App flow with state and PKCE S256; exact callback allowlist; one-time authorization code exchange; no tokens in browser.
- Validate authenticated GitHub identity from `GET /user`; authorize only the immutable numeric owner GitHub user ID, not username alone.
- Opaque `__Host-jarvis_session` cookie with Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite, server-side expiry, revocation and durable session state.
- Fixed GitHub API origin and repository allowlist; GET-only read API for status, tasks, jobs/runs, logs and artifact metadata; strict response minimization and bounded pagination/size/timeouts; ETag/cache and rate-limit behavior.
- CSRF/origin controls, secure headers, no-store for sensitive responses, structured redacted audit events, no secrets/tokens in HTML/JSON/logs/artifacts.
- Protected routes remain fail-closed until OAuth/session and independent review pass. Existing 503/405 behavior is intentional.
- No live browser/iPhone QA, authenticated end-to-end flow, deployed Worker or persistent state store has been demonstrated.

## 6. Identity, model routing and provider quota architecture

Controlling issue: https://github.com/VlDMlNSh/developer-cloud-pool/issues/26

### Source inventory
- MediaHub provider registry source: `ops/qualification/provider_model_registry.json`, previously recorded blob `8c0f95d33a6fc85128b3a7aa37157c2dca74bbca`.
- Related MediaHub orchestrator: `runtime/mediahub_runtime/cloud_orchestrator.py`, previously recorded blob `24c28197df7baca49abd81956752a7a5092506d9`.
- Provider qualification workflow: `.github/workflows/astra-provider-qualification.yml`, previously recorded blob `d3160088fbef4fce152ed7335f0acaa3bb440378`.
- MediaHub cloud auth baseline: `docs/architecture/MH-CLOUD-AUTH-BASELINE.md`, previously recorded blob `075652ad031e92f7d0c9231db6f40f5f45cd77b8`.
- Registry inventory has 24 cloud credential slots in selection order plus a local Ollama route. Multiple distinct slots exist for SiliconFlow, Novita, Z.ai, Cloudflare and Mistral. Inventory is not proof of secret existence, account separation, free quota, or route health.
- A code reference to a GitHub Secret name is not evidence the secret exists. Secret presence/metadata remains NOT VERIFIED unless read through an authorized metadata-only path. Never inspect or print secret values.
- Different API keys may belong to different accounts/projects and have independent quotas. Never combine keys, account identities, billing owners, quota domains or permissions. Never infer separate upstream quota from suffixes such as `_1`/`_2`; map to provider account/project/org quota domain only with provider evidence.
- User reports having Mistral API keys/free quotas; account/project scope, exact quota/reset rules and current eligibility remain NOT VERIFIED.

### Routing and ledger
- PR #28: account-isolated model routing design. OPEN/DRAFT/UNMERGED; branch `docs/provider-quota-agent-routing-2026-11-06`; head `c07e3442a54fabdb74431f00cbbcd9d75280b01b`; base default @ `64d2636...`.
- PR #29: pure provider quota ledger state machine. OPEN/DRAFT/UNMERGED; branch `feat/quota-ledger-state-machine-2026-11-06`; head `34fc78921b16359d136db553d8a51b4a4716995d`; base default @ `64d2636...`. Exact-head Pool Contract Validation run `42211525076` / job `127871048179` previously SUCCESS. No independent review; not qualified/integrated.
- Required credential identity tuple: `credential_ref`, `provider_account_ref`, `quota_domain_id`, provider/model, billing class, qualification evidence, and `paid_fallback_allowed=false` by default.
- Keep upstream quota domains separate from internal pool budgets: requests, tokens, concurrency, estimated spend, task priority, per-agent/per-model limits and global ceilings.
- Quota ledger must persist state and reservation/settlement/reconciliation events; no in-memory-only budget enforcement in a multi-runner environment.
- Error policy: 401/403 = credential/configuration failure; 402 = billing/payment boundary; 429 = scoped cooldown/quota evidence. Never silently fan out to a paid destination on failure.
- LiteLLM Proxy is a mature gateway candidate researched but NOT integrated/qualified. DB-less max_budget is not a safe spend ceiling; production budget enforcement requires persistent PostgreSQL with fail-closed budget enforcement; multi-instance coordination requires Redis. Neither PostgreSQL nor Redis is provisioned/approved. No paid managed service.
- Next model-pool proof must be no-secret/no-provider-call and pinned; measure GitHub-hosted runner install/pull, disk, peak RSS, startup/readiness; parse synthetic account-separated manifest; test unavailable budget-store fail-closed behavior and paid-fallback denial. Do not provision DB/Redis or call providers during this proof.

## 7. Secrets, data handling and trust boundaries

- Never read, copy, reveal, log, commit, embed in browser assets or pass through prompts/artifacts any OAuth credential, GitHub token/PAT/App private key, provider API key, secret value or private key.
- Keep credential references separate from credential material. Keep provider account identity and quota domain distinct.
- Do not infer that a credential exists because workflow YAML references a secret. Do not enumerate secret names/values unless the operation is explicitly metadata-only and authorized; current status is NOT VERIFIED.
- No `secrets: inherit`; do not send controller tokens to agents/models. Do not expose tokens in child run payloads, logs or artifacts.
- No arbitrary URL fetching in the GitHub adapter; fixed API origin, repository allowlist, bounded response, redirect/host validation and strict schema minimization are mandatory.
- No prompt-controlled shell, arbitrary runner labels, arbitrary repository refs or dynamic code execution in the worker control plane.
- Audit every authorization/approval/dispatch/state transition with immutable IDs, timestamps, actor provenance and redacted evidence.
- Separate read-only experience plane from mutation/control plane. The web console is not a privileged authority merely because the owner is signed in.
- Preserve Jarvis, ASTRA A0 and MediaHub Product State Authority separation.

## 8. Agent executors and orchestration policy

- Use free routes only; no paid fallback. GitHub is the cloud development/orchestration environment; physical servers are only for explicitly permitted local compute.
- Gemini must be invoked exclusively through the approved `.github/workflows/gemini-batch-dispatch-controller.yml` in MediaHub OS. Before dispatch, verify controller contract, exact-main CI, secret/variable scope metadata without values, effective governance, security review and trusted-main no-secret probe. If any gate is missing, status is NOT RUN/BLOCKED. Do not bypass the controller or claim an individual assignment unless it was actually delivered.
- Prefer three independent roles where the approved controller supports them: Agent 1 research/implementation; Agent 2 contract/test review; Agent 3 security, authority and provenance audit. Record immutable target SHA, controller run ID, child run/job IDs, terminal statuses, reports/artifact digests and verification.
- Claude Code may be used only on confirmed server 3 through an allowed free route. Verify exact SentinelX host ID, capabilities, allowlist and permission before use. Never use server 3 for Gemini.
- Before browser automation, read the installed agent-browser skill and verify the browser runtime. Browser operation must remain within the authorized host/session and website permissions.
- When an executor is blocked, continue independent safe work; do not switch to an unapproved transport.
- A ChatGPT /next message is not a GitHub event and is not proof of agent dispatch.

## 9. Cloudflare / hosting / persistence

- Candidate: Cloudflare Workers Static Assets + Hono; not yet deployed.
- Namespace `jarvis-developer-cloud-pool.workers.dev` was provisioned and previously read back.
- Workers Free entitlement: NOT VERIFIED at last recorded read because billing read permission was unavailable; verify without changing payment or plan.
- Cloudflare Access is excluded from the no-card path in current design.
- Persistent state is not yet proven. GitHub Actions runners are ephemeral. Durable task, quota, session and checkpoint state needs an explicitly approved free-tier persistence strategy with concurrency/consistency semantics.
- No PostgreSQL/Redis or other paid state service provisioned. Avoid selecting a storage product until its actual free tier, limits, durability, region, data retention and security controls are verified.
- Do not deploy until auth, persistence, free entitlement, security review, and fail-closed tests pass.

## 11. Evidence ledger and what is / is not proven

**Verified/documented evidence**
- Default branch HEAD and branch inventory were read through GitHub API on 2026-11-06.
- Active repository ruleset collection currently contains ruleset ID 26550182 with enforcement active; exact effective rules and selector still require a direct read before merge/dispatch.
- PR #24 named exact-head workflow runs 42188894226 and 42188894227 previously SUCCESS.
- PR #25 named exact-head workflow runs 42188468546 and 42188468584 previously SUCCESS.
- PR #29 exact-head Pool Contract Validation run 42211525076 / job 127871048179 previously SUCCESS.
- PR #30 exact-head run 42216422883 / job 127887461269 COMPLETED/SUCCESS, exact head `ad9f9ac598a2414b5209b6923094b16be64630ae`; job steps read back. No live external OAuth/API request.
- Documentation branch existing context/checkpoint/report were read back before consolidation. Previous context blob SHA `4ce4c804aa0ae634a81b27cb1afc208ec252a242`; checkpoint blob SHA `bd77c65c4243750c47905037106d8633e71ec6f9`; report blob SHA `9623874dbab3c3cc55da6fe1177b16b301860af9`.

**NOT VERIFIED / NOT RUN / NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- Real authenticated web console deployment and iPhone/desktop browser QA.
- Live GitHub OAuth, production session persistence/expiry/revocation and owner identity authorization.
- Fixed-origin live GitHub REST adapter and real task/run/log data.
- Durable state persistence and cross-runner recovery.
- Cloudflare Workers Free entitlement and Worker deployment.
- Actual pool Supervisor/Worker/DSH runtime execution and general-purpose agent execution.
- Runner resource profile, DSH qualification and cloud profile qualification.
- Actual provider secret existence, credential-to-account mapping, free quota status/reset/eligibility, and provider route health.
- Production router, provider calls, quota enforcement in a deployed multi-runner runtime.
- Independent security review for PRs #24/#25/#28/#29/#30 and broader control plane.
- Formal Contour A qualification/acceptance.
- Gemini/Claude execution for this Cloud Pool workstream; no claim of dispatch or agent assignment.
- Mobile native app and local media assistant (Contour B).

## 12. Mature components and reuse decisions

- Hono + Cloudflare Workers Static Assets: selected prototype path for web console, subject to free-tier proof and security qualification.
- `panva/oauth4webapi`: protocol engine candidate; synthetic compatibility proof passed, but NOT accepted as production auth by itself and not a GitHub REST adapter.
- Bezzie 1.4.2: rejected as direct GitHub OAuth drop-in (OIDC-provider oriented).
- Auth0 Hono SDK: not selected; introduces external Auth0 broker/account dependency.
- LiteLLM Proxy: researched mature gateway candidate; not integrated. Budget controls need persistent backing store and cannot be treated as upstream free-quota oracle.
- PostgreSQL/Redis: not provisioned/approved; do not introduce paid managed services.
- DSH: candidate runtime only; not qualified.
- Before building new subsystems, search mature GitHub components, pin exact source/version, review license/security/provenance, verify interface fit and resource footprint, then make a bounded proof-of-fit.

## 13. Required /next operating protocol

At the beginning of every /next:
1. Refresh default branch HEAD, docs branch HEAD, relevant feature refs, PR states, issues, exact-head CI, review submissions/threads, ruleset details and executor availability.
2. Read this file first, then open the relevant primary contracts/reports/checkpoints and the MediaHub canonical map/bootstrap/roadmap where cross-project dependencies are involved. If Contents API returns empty, resolve blob SHA or raw file.
3. Fix one immutable target SHA for the planned work. State inputs, scope, exclusions, security boundary and acceptance criteria.
4. Search for mature GitHub components before custom implementation.
5. Execute one bounded, high-value, independently verifiable pass. Keep secrets, paid services, live provider calls and dispatch out unless all specific gates permit them.
6. Run relevant tests/CI and inspect exact-head job logs. Empty status arrays, missing runs, inaccessible reviews or incomplete logs are NOT VERIFIED.
7. Read changed files back and record commit/blob SHA. Never merge without exact-head CI, effective ruleset/governance, provenance, review and no-data-loss checks.
8. After a significant pass, update this file first; update checkpoint/report/map only with short navigation/status pointers or evidence-specific detail. Avoid duplicating the full context in multiple documents.
9. Record actual status using PLANNED, DISPATCHED, RUNNING, SUCCEEDED, VERIFIED, QUALIFIED, ACCEPTED, NOT RUN, BLOCKED, FAILED, NOT VERIFIED.
10. End with factual status, evidence links, blockers and the next concrete step.

## 14. Current next step

**Next engineering step:** implement a fixed-origin, read-only GitHub REST adapter as a bounded synthetic proof on top of the Hono web console. Cover repository allowlisting, strict API origin/redirect rules, bounded pagination and response size, ETag/cache behavior, timeout/rate-limit handling, and response minimization. Use synthetic fixtures only; no live GitHub token, no real OAuth session, no task dispatch, no provider calls. Keep adapter unmounted from protected routes until production OAuth/session and independent security review pass.

In parallel, re-read Cloudflare entitlement through available read-only integration and verify the exact free-tier hosting constraints without payment changes. Do not deploy.

**Contour A status: NOT ACCEPTED.** Do not start Contour B.

## 2A. Cross-project precedence and supersession — Cloud Pool is authoritative for cloud development

Effective 2026-11-06. This section resolves source conflicts between the Cloud Pool repository and MediaHub OS documentation.

1. **Cloud Pool engineering authority:** for the cloud development environment, remote web console, GitHub-hosted execution, Supervisor/Worker, task queue, runtime, free-tier hosting, provider routing, quota ledger, cloud persistence, and cloud-environment security/operations, the latest owner-directed and technically verified decisions in VlDMlNSh/developer-cloud-pool take precedence. The Cloud Pool Основной branch, its accepted changes, current Issues/PRs and exact-head evidence are the primary sources. A draft PR is a proposal, not an accepted implementation; owner-directed priorities are binding target requirements but do not prove implementation.
2. **MediaHub is a consumer, not the cloud-environment control plane:** MediaHub Baseline 2.0, Product State Authority and product-specific contracts remain authoritative for MediaHub product behavior and its own state. MediaHub's older cloud-environment implementation instructions must not override later Cloud Pool architecture or force the pool to inherit MediaHub-specific topology.
3. **Retain compatible cross-project constraints:** no paid fallback or unapproved billing; secret isolation and no secret-value inspection; distinct provider accounts/quota domains; least privilege, provenance, audit, fail-closed behavior; Jarvis / ASTRA A0 / Product State Authority separation; Gemini controller restrictions only when operating the MediaHub Gemini workstream; local/server executor restrictions only when that executor is explicitly in scope.
4. **Do not impose on Cloud Pool unless separately re-admitted:** MediaHub-specific ASTRA GOLD A0 DAG ownership, Alamo/server-3 Claude executor, FCC/FreeLLMAPI/OmniRoute route choices, user-owned MediaHub destination lanes, MediaHub MEDIAHUB_GITHUB_TOKEN controller transport and Issue #301 bridge. These are MediaHub workstream contracts, not default Cloud Pool infrastructure requirements. Reuse requires a separate interface, authority, cost, security and runtime admission decision.
5. **Cloud Pool decisions currently controlling the target:** (a) web console is the first access milestone for iPhone and desktop; native iOS and external servers are deferred; (b) GitHub-hosted execution remains the cloud baseline and Actions runners are ephemeral, not persistent hosts; (c) Hono + Workers Static Assets is a hosting candidate only, subject to verified free entitlement and deployment gates; (d) production web auth is server-side GitHub OAuth, immutable numeric owner ID, opaque server-side session, GET-only read API; Cloudflare Access is not required for the no-card path; (e) protected reads remain fail-closed and mutations rejected until auth/security gates pass; (f) provider identities are isolated by credential_ref, provider_account_ref, quota_domain_id; upstream quotas are separate from internal pool budgets; paid fallback is denied; (g) quota state needs durable persistence before multi-runner enforcement; (h) dispatch requires owner-bound approval, immutable SHA/profile binding, single-use approval, provenance and effective governance; (i) no secrets, live provider calls, dispatch or deployment without their specific gates.
6. **Status and supersession rule:** compare decision date, owner direction, merge/acceptance state, exact source SHA and evidence. Newer does not automatically mean accepted. If a newer Cloud Pool PR is DRAFT/UNMERGED, record it as a target proposal and do not silently replace accepted default-branch behavior. Preserve older MediaHub text as historical provenance; mark conflicting operational requirements SUPERSEDED FOR CLOUD POOL rather than deleting audit history.
7. **Bootstrap rule:** when MediaHub Bootstrap/Map/Checkpoint/Roadmap is read for cross-project context, extract only product constraints and compatible shared security invariants. Do not import its Cloud Pool implementation mandates wholesale. For Cloud Pool /next, this Context Window and Cloud Pool primary refs are authoritative for cloud-environment work.

Source comparison used: Cloud Pool Context Window blob 0dcba5a910070fcdc59cf3f07949310c725ef7ae; Cloud Pool PRs #7, #19, #20, #24–#30 refreshed 2026-11-06; MediaHub Bootstrap blob 75f30750183efe8c6877368e9f0ada48f8e81ea7; MediaHub checkpoint blob fd312ded05dd1898bd36d776a9669bb02920720d (latest indexed wave observed: 477, 2026-10-30). MediaHub checkpoint is older than the 2026-11-06 Cloud Pool decisions and is not a source for superseding them.
