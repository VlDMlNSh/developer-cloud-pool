# Continuation checkpoint — 2026-11-08

The unified project state is maintained in [GITHUB-CONTEXT-WINDOW.md](../context/GITHUB-CONTEXT-WINDOW.md). This checkpoint is intentionally a short pointer; do not duplicate the evidence ledger here.

Latest engineering pass: [PR #36/#37/#39 authorization and durable-claim composition audit](../reports/2026-11-08-pr36-pr37-pr39-authorization-composition-audit.md).

Current phase: Cloud Development Pool Contour A. Contour A remains BLOCKED / NOT ACCEPTED. Contour B remains DEFERRED. Both dispatch gates stay fail-closed.

Current branch heads:
- PR #36: `e11fc90e50bd20b166207af64551c49cfa80ffb4`; exact-head CI 2 SUCCESS.
- PR #37: `5587a4e013507b5be330fd0c49ce1fc836faa946`; exact-head CI 2 SUCCESS.
- PR #39: `ecc7193cdc7b1e58fdba6c27c1a9fdb51f2bb833`; exact-head D1 CI SUCCESS.

All three PRs have zero formal reviews and zero inline review threads. The local D1 consume and claim/outbox proofs are not integrated with the Supervisor/Worker path. PR #37 still relies on a non-CAS GitHub Issue label claim. No trusted issuer/owner model, signed approval verification, trusted clock, lease/fencing, outbox consumer, recovery protocol or remote D1 qualification has been accepted.

Next bounded action: write a formal integrated claim/lease/outbox design decision and threat model; obtain independent security review before implementation or dispatch. No production dispatch/deployment.


Latest pass: [integrated claim/lease/outbox design pass](../reports/2026-11-08-integrated-claim-lease-outbox-design-pass.md). The proposed protocol is documented in [integrated claim/lease/outbox threat model](../architecture/2026-11-08-integrated-claim-lease-outbox-threat-model.md). Design only; implementation, independent review and remote qualification NOT RUN. Contour A remains BLOCKED / NOT ACCEPTED; Contour B DEFERRED. Dispatch remains fail-closed. Next: authorized independent review before implementation planning.


Latest 2026-11-08 pass: Issue #38's required alternatives comparison was added to [integrated claim/lease/outbox threat model](../architecture/2026-11-08-integrated-claim-lease-outbox-threat-model.md), with report [durable claim alternatives review](../reports/2026-11-08-durable-claim-alternatives-review.md). Labels are rejected as authoritative CAS; dedicated state-repo refs are candidate-only; D1 remains preferred but unqualified. If neither backend passes real contention/recovery/security gates, dispatch remains disabled. Implementation, remote backend qualification and independent review NOT RUN. Contour A BLOCKED / NOT ACCEPTED; Contour B DEFERRED.


Latest 2026-11-08 pass: [D1 Free-tier feasibility and PR #27 recheck](../reports/2026-11-08-d1-free-tier-feasibility-and-pr27-recheck.md). Published Workers Free/D1 limits are documented, but account-specific entitlement remains NOT VERIFIED. PR #27 exact-head CI NOT VERIFIED; independent review NOT RUN. D1 remains preferred candidate only, not production-selected or qualified. No remote DB, implementation, dispatch or deployment. Contour A BLOCKED / NOT ACCEPTED; Contour B DEFERRED. Next: authorized independent architecture/security review before backend qualification.


Latest 2026-11-08 pass: [PR #36/#37/#39 exact-head and default-branch boundary recheck](../reports/2026-11-08-pr36-pr37-pr39-exact-head-and-default-boundary-recheck.md). Exact named workflow runs for PR #36, #37 and #39 are COMPLETED/SUCCESS at recorded immutable SHAs, but all have zero formal reviews/threads. Default branch still contains legacy Supervisor `workflow_run` + `actions: write` and Worker `workflow_dispatch`/issue-writing report chain; PR #37's narrower reusable Worker replacement is draft/unmerged. Live dispatch gate values NOT VERIFIED; no dispatch attempted. Remote D1 and independent review NOT RUN. Contour A BLOCKED / NOT ACCEPTED; Contour B DEFERRED. Next: read-only source review and authorized independent security review before merge or implementation.


Latest 2026-11-08 follow-up: [PR #36/#37/#39 authorization composition audit](../reports/2026-11-08-pr36-pr37-pr39-authorization-composition-audit.md), with [Context Window addendum](../context/2026-11-08-authorization-composition-addendum.md). PR #37 latest head `5587a4e013507b5be330fd0c49ce1fc836faa946`; exact-head boundary and contract workflows `42284051309` / `42284051311` SUCCESS. PR #36/#37/#39 each have 0 reviews and 0 inline threads. PR #37 remains non-CAS label claim; issue label/body do not prove signed owner approval. D1 consume/claim/outbox proofs remain separate from Supervisor/Worker; trusted issuer/clock, lease/fencing, outbox consumer/recovery and remote D1 qualification are absent. Default branch remains unchanged with legacy privileged chain. No dispatch, runtime execution, secrets, provider/model calls, resources or deployment. Contour A BLOCKED / NOT ACCEPTED; Contour B DEFERRED. Next: independent security review and integrated authorization protocol decision; no merge/dispatch before all gates.


2026-11-08 branch synchronization update: [branch provenance audit](../reports/2026-11-08-pr36-pr37-pr39-branch-provenance-and-stack-sync-audit.md). PR #36 live branch resolves to `e11fc90e50bd20b166207af64551c49cfa80ffb4`; its PR body head `7571f82...` is stale. PR #37 current head `5587a4e...`. PR #39 `ecc7193...` is based at `9ef7e4a...` and is 17 ahead/0 behind that base, but diverges from current PR #36 parent `e11fc90...` by 17 ahead/1 behind; the missing parent commit only updates D1 validation workflow push triggers. All named exact-head CI runs succeeded at their recorded SHAs, but no formal reviews or inline threads exist. Independent security review NOT RUN. No dispatch/config/code/deployment changes. Contour A BLOCKED / NOT ACCEPTED; Contour B DEFERRED. Next: independent review, then synchronize PR #39 to current parent and rerun exact-head CI.



Latest correction: [PR #39 stack graph/content/CI correction](../reports/2026-11-08-pr39-stack-graph-content-and-ci-correction.md). Although graph compare is 17 ahead / 1 behind, parent and child D1 validation workflow blobs are identical (`cb31bda...`) and PR #39's combined merge tree `77b3ce30...` passed run `42329993548`; do not synchronize/rebase solely to normalize graph. No merge authorization: independent review 0, remote D1 and lease/outbox runtime NOT QUALIFIED. Contour A BLOCKED.



Latest pass: author-side pre-review of the integrated claim/lease/outbox threat model is documented in [2026-11-08 integrated claim protocol pre-review gap analysis](../reports/2026-11-08-integrated-claim-protocol-pre-review-gap-analysis.md). It is not independent review. PR #36/#37/#39 named exact-head CI remains SUCCESS on recorded heads; formal reviews remain 0. Issue #38 is an Issue, not PR. Implementation, remote D1 qualification and dispatch remain NOT RUN. Contour A BLOCKED; Contour B DEFERRED.



## 2026-11-08 — governance and independent-review gate refresh

- Report: [governance and independent-review gate refresh](../reports/2026-11-08-governance-and-review-gate-refresh.md), blob `efb791bc81ec684b5dd060c37e0ba4c5f811590f`; report commit `ea992fb3133eeb173d0329bba38501384d95747e`.
- Default branch `Основной` remains at `197ba98d0dc7d8437d759dd25bee8750d02e59ae`. Active ruleset ID `26550182` applies to this branch, but requires **zero** approving reviews, has no required reviewers and disables CODEOWNERS review/extra approval for unattributed changes. Bypass actors empty; current-user bypass never. Classic branch endpoint still reports protected=false. This is not sufficient governance enforcement for an independent security gate.
- Default Supervisor at this SHA still has `workflow_run: completed`, `issues: write`, `actions: write`; default Worker still exposes `workflow_dispatch`. PR #37's replacement remains draft/unmerged.
- Exact-head CI remains named SUCCESS for PR #36 (`42329438308`, `42329438351`), #37 (`42284051311`, `42284051309`) and #39 (`42329993548`). All three have 0 formal reviews and 0 inline threads. Combined commit-status contexts empty / NOT VERIFIED.
- Issue #38 remains OPEN. Live dispatch variable values remain NOT VERIFIED; historical Issue #1 readback is stale and was not used as current evidence.
- Independent security review NOT RUN; remote D1 qualification NOT RUN; implementation/integration NOT AUTHORIZED / NOT RUN; dispatch NOT RUN; Contour A BLOCKED / NOT ACCEPTED; Contour B DEFERRED.
- Next: secure an authorized independent reviewer and a governance-enforced approval requirement through the authorized path; no merge, dispatch, resource creation or deployment before gates pass.

Latest 2026-11-08 pass: [PR #37 latest-head finalizer review](../reports/2026-11-08-pr37-latest-head-finalizer-review.md). Current PR #37 head `1be8672c1be1a720b6c813dcafff5c020b6456ae`; prior workflow-context placement defect F1 corrected and exact-head Boundary Validation run `42484039940` plus Pool Contract Validation run `42484039932` SUCCESS. F2 remains: Finalizer checks only `pool:claimed` and does not bind the terminal write to immutable envelope/body/profile, issue state, run identity or claim generation. Static finding; live race NOT RUN. PR #37 remains OPEN/DRAFT/UNMERGED; independent authorized review NOT VERIFIED; current live dispatch variables NOT VERIFIED; no dispatch/worker/provider/deployment. Contour A BLOCKED / NOT ACCEPTED; Contour B DEFERRED. Next: test-first F2 remediation with negative mutation/stale-claim tests, then exact-head CI and authorized independent review. Context Window refreshed in commit `d921f8d8806981c6b6f92383c5a629344a2df085`.

Latest 2026-11-08 pass: [Gemini controller routing gap for Cloud Pool independent review](../reports/2026-11-08-gemini-controller-cloud-pool-review-routing-gap.md). The approved MediaHub controller's review mode is fixed to FCC PR #506/#508 and target SHA `074f20eb495666946a14410ab88d566aaa754f24`; its agents mode is scoped to MediaHub Issue #301. It cannot currently review Cloud Pool PR #36/#37/#39. No Gemini dispatch or secret access. Cloud Pool-specific independent review route NOT IMPLEMENTED / NOT AUTHORIZED; independent review NOT RUN; remote D1 NOT QUALIFIED; dispatch fail-closed. Context Window is authoritative and updated; next: authorized review-route contract/governance decision. Contour A BLOCKED / NOT ACCEPTED; Contour B DEFERRED.
