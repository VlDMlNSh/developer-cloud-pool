# Continuation checkpoint — projection delivery stack — 2026-11-11

- Status: SOURCE AUDIT COMPLETED / INTEGRATION NOT QUALIFIED.
- Immutable base: `Основной@221f216c00ca7e5596bcc682ba185ad155a10603`.
- Working documentation branch: `docs/projection-stack-reconciliation-2026-11-11`.
- Report: [Projection delivery stack source and compatibility audit](../reports/2026-11-11-projection-delivery-stack-source-audit.md).
- PR #58 exact head: `5caeb60f7a45d836c6ad1eea2fb86e20995da025`; PR #59 exact head: `22200226da4f1af30645cf441a639db6893e9310`.
- #58→#59 is a 10-commit direct stack. Current default→#59 is DIVERGED 147 ahead / 62 behind; do not merge or rebase the old stack wholesale.
- Audit actor patch branch `b9731547afaefde2d22e704122e73615ce85876c` diverges from #59 by 3 ahead / 18 behind. #59 migration 0007 already uses COALESCE(NEW.lease_owner, OLD.lease_owner), so do not blindly cherry-pick the migration 0006 actor fix.
- Critical gap: acknowledgeProjectionDelivered accepts lease identity/time but no verified projection receipt or digest. The local D1 row can be acknowledged delivered without cryptographic/structured proof of the external projection.
- Critical liveness gap: deadLetterExpiredProjection requires same lease owner/generation; it cannot reap an orphaned fifth lease.
- Next: create a clean integration candidate from current default; port only reviewed source files; implement injected local-only orchestrator with receipt-bound acknowledgement and failure/restart/stale-lease tests. Preserve dispatch:false and no live credentials.
- Hosted D1 remains NOT AUTHORIZED / NOT RUN. Recovery Actor issuer/trusted-time remains BLOCKED. Contour A BLOCKED / NOT ACCEPTED; Contour B DEFERRED.

## Correction — projection verification receipt

The reconciler success path returns `PROJECTION_VERIFIED`, `projection_verified: true`, `eventId`, `payloadDigest` and verified managed labels after final read-back. The gap is not that success always returns false. The gap is that no receipt is bound to the D1 delivery lease generation and the acknowledgement function accepts no receipt. Next implementation must bind outbox ID, digest and generation, and validate them in the D1 acknowledgement. Do not claim cryptographic signing without a real qualified signature mechanism.
