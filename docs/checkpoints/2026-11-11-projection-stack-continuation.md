# Continuation checkpoint — projection delivery stack — 2026-11-11

- Status: SOURCE AUDIT COMPLETED / INTEGRATION NOT QUALIFIED.
- Immutable base: `Основной@221f216c00ca7e5596bcc682ba185ad155a10603`.
- Working documentation branch: `docs/projection-stack-reconciliation-2026-11-11`.
- Report: [Projection delivery stack source and compatibility audit](../reports/2026-11-11-projection-delivery-stack-source-audit.md).
- PR #58 exact head: `5caeb60f7a45d836c6ad1eea2fb86e20995da025`; PR #59 exact head: `22200226da4f1af30645cf441a639db6893e9310`.
- #58→#59 is a 10-commit direct stack. Current default→#59 is DIVERGED 147 ahead / 62 behind; do not merge or rebase the old stack wholesale.
- Audit actor patch branch `b9731547afaefde2d22e704122e73615ce85876c` diverges from #59 by 3 ahead / 18 behind. #59 migration 0007 already uses COALESCE(NEW.lease_owner, OLD.lease_owner), so do not blindly cherry-pick the migration 0006 actor fix.
- Critical gap: acknowledgeProjectionDelivered accepts lease identity/time but no verified projection receipt or digest. The local D1 row can be acknowledged delivered without cryptographic/structured proof of the external projection.
- Critical liveness gap: deadLetterExpiredProjection requires same lease owner/generation; it cannot reap an orphaned fifth lease.
- Next: create a clean integration candidate from current default; port only reviewed source files; implement injected local-only orchestrator with receipt-bound acknowledgement and failure/restart/stale-lease tests. Preserve dispatch:false and no live credentials.
- Hosted D1 remains NOT AUTHORIZED / NOT RUN. Recovery Actor issuer/trusted-time remains BLOCKED. Contour A BLOCKED / NOT ACCEPTED; Contour B DEFERRED.

## Correction — projection verification receipt

The reconciler success path returns `PROJECTION_VERIFIED`, `projection_verified: true`, `eventId`, `payloadDigest` and verified managed labels after final read-back. The gap is not that success always returns false. The gap is that no receipt is bound to the D1 delivery lease generation and the acknowledgement function accepts no receipt. Next implementation must bind outbox ID, digest and generation, and validate them in the D1 acknowledgement. Do not claim cryptographic signing without a real qualified signature mechanism.


## Current-default integration feasibility recheck (2026-11-11)

- Confirmed repository default branch `Основной` at immutable SHA `221f216c00ca7e5596bcc682ba185ad155a10603`.
- Recursive tree: 47 entries; no `proofs/d1-ledger/**`, `package.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, or D1 migration/test harness. Only existing executable project files are supervisor/contract scripts and workflows. Therefore receipt implementation cannot be meaningfully integrated/tested on current default without transplanting the complete D1 proof harness and its test/config/migration/CI dependencies.
- PR #58/#59 remain isolated draft proof stack; do not transplant a single function without the full harness, package script union, migration order and workflow branch/path-filter union.
- Existing Ledgerline review remains architecture-only; its Durable Objects authority model is not a drop-in replacement for this D1 lease model. No dependency adopted.
- No code changed. Next: decide/qualify a complete local D1 harness transplant onto current default versus continued isolated proof branch. Then implement receipt-bound acknowledgement inside the selected testable harness. Keep `dispatch:false`; hosted D1 NOT AUTHORIZED / NOT RUN.


## Governance and proof-stack revalidation — 2026-11-11

- Report: [governance and proof-stack revalidation](../reports/2026-11-11-governance-and-proof-stack-revalidation.md), commit `eef958725e2db6f065a56e04385c98c0e911c66e`.
- Active ruleset `26550182` applies to `Основной`: PR required, deletion/non-fast-forward prohibited, review-thread resolution required, 0 required approvals, no bypass actors. Branch-protection endpoint says protected=false/status checks off; active ruleset is the operative evidence. Independent review remains a project acceptance requirement not guaranteed by GitHub.
- PR #58 exact head `5caeb60f7a45d836c6ad1eea2fb86e20995da025`: compare 141 ahead / 62 behind (diverged); Actions run `43043284086`, job `130600450879`, success; local Workers-runtime D1 proof only.

- Current default tree has 47 entries and no D1 proof harness/package/test config. PR #58/#59 complete proof stack requires full manifest before transplant: package scripts/lockfile, ordered migrations 0001–0008, source/tests/config, workflow branch/path filter union, receipt-bound acknowledgement, and explicit issuer/trusted-time/orphan fifth-lease exclusions.
- No source/runtime/schema/workflow/permission/secret/dispatch/hosted-resource/deployment/merge changes. Dispatch FAIL-CLOSED. Contour A BLOCKED / NOT ACCEPTED; Contour B DEFERRED.
- Next: file-by-file transplant manifest from exact #58/#59 patches and current default tree; independent review before branch mutation.

## D1 proof harness transplant manifest — 2026-11-11

- Manifest: [D1 proof harness transplant manifest](../reports/2026-11-11-d1-proof-harness-transplant-manifest.md), commit `ef5258670667d0c61d45074a34ee5c0ecbcf3d42`.
- Exact ancestry correction: PR #58 head `5caeb60f7a45d836c6ad1eea2fb86e20995da025` and PR #59 head `22200226da4f1af30645cf441a639db6893e9310` are DIVERGED, 10 ahead / 4 behind, merge base `6f7953e4abec3cc564984ee3635cdb7717ae5d5e`. #59 is based on the earlier shared proof base, not the latest #58 head.
- The four #58-only commits absent from #59 add the projection envelope contract, projection-envelope.mjs, its tests, and a package syntax check. Exact PR #59 package script omits node --check src/projection-envelope.mjs; copying it blindly loses coverage. Preserve this check in the logical union.
- Manifest inventories all proof paths, migration order 0001–0008, workflow filter union, package/lock/config/test ownership, ACK receipt requirements and explicit exclusions.
- Concrete code defect remains: acknowledgeProjectionDelivered accepts no receipt. No integrated actor exists. Same-owner fifth-lease dead-letter restriction remains; do not relax without issuer/trusted-time authority.
- Manifest inventory: VERIFIED against exact PR heads and current default tree. Independent review: NOT RUN. Code integration: NOT RUN. Hosted D1: NOT AUTHORIZED / NOT RUN. Dispatch FAIL-CLOSED.
- Next: independent review of manifest and exact source patches; only after acceptance create immutable candidate branch and implement receipt-bound ACK with negative-first local D1 tests.
- Contour A BLOCKED / NOT ACCEPTED; Contour B DEFERRED.
